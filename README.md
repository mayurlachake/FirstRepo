Strudent Fees Installment Program

  In this program Students can pay their fees in Installments in Coaching classes. A student can decide the number of installments.
While paying the installment amount, the student can pay less or more than the installment amount.

If the student is paying more than the installment amount, the excess amount should be deducted from the next installment(s).

If the student is paying less than the installment amount, then ask the student for what to do with the remaining amount:
Add it to the next installment or create a new installment.
